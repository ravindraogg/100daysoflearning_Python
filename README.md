# 100DaysOfLearning_Python

Welcome to my 100 Days of Learning Python journey! In this repository, I'll document my progress and share what I've learned each day. Follow along and learn with me!

## Day 1: Introduction to Python

Today, I started my Python learning journey. Here's what I covered:

### Introduction to Python
- Learned about the history and significance of Python.
- Understood why Python is popular and widely used.

### Data Types
- **Integers**: Whole numbers, e.g., `5`, `-10`
- **Strings**: Sequence of characters, e.g., `"Hello, World!"`
- **Booleans**: Represents `True` or `False`
- **None**: Special data type to denote the absence of a value
- **Float**: Numbers with a decimal point, e.g., `3.14`, `-2.0`

### Variables
- Learned how to create variables and assign values to them.
- Understood the rules for naming variables.
- Practiced using variables in simple Python scripts.

## Day 2: Conditional Statements

Today, I focused on conditional statements and wrote some programs. Here's what I learned:

Conditional Statements
- Used if, else, and elif statements to make decisions in Python programs.
- Understood how to use comparison operators (<, >, ==, !=, <=, >=) in conditionals.
- Practiced writing conditional statements to control the flow of my programs.

### Example 1 
Grade sorting using if, elif, else.
- Condition_1 if marks has been awarded as 99 it gives output as A Grade.
- Condition_2 if marks has been awarded as 54 it gives output as F Grade.
- Condition_3 if marks has been awarded as 80 it gives output ad B Grade.
